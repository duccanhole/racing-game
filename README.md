## Horse race board game

### Intro
- This game is develop and maintain by me.
### Story
- Me, a web developer; want to find something new to do that help me stay inspired in programing. So I thought why not try to make a game with passion, and treat it as a interest personal project to do in my free time besides my main job. This is also a good opportunity for me to observe and challenge myself to see how persistent and serious I can be in this journey. So I started to plan, think ideas, find the best suitable technologies, learn new knowledge, .... April 13, 2023, this repo was created, marking the first step to implement my goal. Whether you happen to pass by here or not, I am always grateful and want to give you my sincerest thanks for taking the time to read all of this. Wish you a happy day!
### Game idea
- Inspired by the classic horse race board game, I set out to enhance it by incorporating more strategic elements and reducing the role of chance. The original idea was that each piece would have a unique skill, something that could be combined with each other. When a piece enters its castle, it will build a fortress, which will prevent enemies from passing. During development, I may come up with new and more interesting ideas, but I will try to keep it around the original core concepts: strategy and team combination. The latest updates will be noted by me here (or in the dev-log folder).

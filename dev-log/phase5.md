## Phase 5 - add UI and effect basic

## Time estimate

- ~ 2 month

## Status

- Planing

## Description

- To complete this phase, I think I have to learn a little (or more :3) about pixel art and animate
- Pixel art has been interesting to me for a long time. So I've always wanted the opportunity to try this new field, and it's very exciting for me. I will try my best!
- List of task I intent to do:
- Create map
- Create game assets
- Create piece
- Add sound effect !? (if I have enough time :D)
- Today, I learned something about pixel animation:
    - You should split your object to multiple layer
    - You should draw a frame before draw detail

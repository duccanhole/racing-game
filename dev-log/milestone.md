In conceptualizing and planning, I planned to divide this project into 8 phases. As follows:
- <b><u>Phase 1</u></b>: make idea, plan, write document [link](./phase1.md)
- <b><u>Phase 2</u></b>: find the suitable technology
- <b><u>Phase 3</u></b>: setup project, implement technology
- <b><u>Phase 4</u></b>: develop the base basic game
- <b><u>Phase 5</u></b>: develop game advance
- <b><u>Phase 6</u></b>: set up database and develop server
- <b><u>Phase 7</u></b>: review and finalize the necessary features
- <b><u>Phase 8</u></b>: publish game
Note: this is just the initial plan, may be updated to be more suitable in future development.
The detail of each phase will be written in another file.
